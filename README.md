# 🧠 VPOD: Vector-Based Point Ownership and Destruction

A novel scoring and strategy system for board games (like Tic Tac Toe and beyond) that replaces traditional win conditions with **vector control**, **potential ownership**, and **destruction mechanics**.

---

## 🌟 What is VPOD?

> Developed by **Sibusiso Mahlangu** in 2025, VPOD reimagines turn-based games using concepts of potential, strategic ownership, and resource decay.

### Key Concepts:
- 🧭 **Vectors** as possible win paths
- 🎯 **Position-based point scoring**
- 💣 **Vector destruction** when contested
- 🧠 **Emergent gameplay** via system pressure and decay

## 🎮 Proposed Implementations

### 🧱 Phase 1: Core System
- [ ] Base implementation of VPOD logic
- [ ] Dynamic scoring engine
- [ ] Support for 3x3, 4x4, 5x5 boards
- [ ] Vector tracking and scoring visualization

### 🤖 Phase 2: AI Systems
- [ ] Simple Greedy AI
- [ ] Minimax Algorithm
- [ ] MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) Exploration
- [ ] AI Evaluation based on vector control metrics
